The capybara, scientifically known as Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, is the largest living rodent in the world and is native to South America. Capybaras are social animals, often found in groups of 10-20, though these groups can swell to over 100 individuals during the dry season. Their habitat includes savannas, dense forests, and water bodies, as they are semi-aquatic creatures. Categorized as herbivores, their diet mainly consists of grasses and aquatic plants. They are excellent swimmers, capable of holding their breath underwater for up to five minutes. The species is currently not threatened, although they are hunted in some regions for their meat and pelts. Capybaras have adapted well to urban environments and have even gained popularity in various cultural contexts, including memes and animal cafés in places like Japan.
The capybara (_Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris_) is the largest living rodent, native to South America. It inhabits savannas and dense forests near bodies of water and is known for its highly social behavior, typically living in groups of 10 to 20, though larger groups can form. Capybaras are herbivores, primarily grazing on grasses and aquatic plants, and they are also known to consume their own feces to aid digestion. These semiaquatic mammals, characterized by their barrel-shaped body, are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes. They have few natural predators and are commonly hunted for their meat and hides. In urban settings, capybaras have adapted well and are found in various zoos and parks, where they are known for their docile nature.
